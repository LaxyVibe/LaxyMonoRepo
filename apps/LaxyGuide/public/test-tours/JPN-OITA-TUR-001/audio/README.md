# Sample Audio Files for Testing

This directory contains placeholder audio files for testing the time-synchronized features.

For a real implementation, you would replace these with actual audio recordings.

## Audio File Durations:
- step1-*.mp3: 45 seconds
- step2-*.mp3: 60 seconds  
- step3-*.mp3: 75 seconds

## Languages:
- eng: English
- jpn: Japanese
- kor: Korean
- cht: Traditional Chinese
- chs: Simplified Chinese

Note: The actual audio files are not included in this repository. For testing, you can use any audio files with the correct durations, or create silent audio files for demonstration purposes.
