# Sample Images for Kaimonji Onsen Audio Guide

This directory contains sample images for testing the time-synchronized image functionality.

For demonstration purposes, we're using publicly available placeholder images:

## Image Mapping:

- `onsen-historical-photo.jpg` -> https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=2  
- `onsen-entrance-interior.jpg` -> https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=3
- `onsen-main-bath.jpg` -> https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=4
- `onsen-water-source.jpg` -> https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=5
- `onsen-steam-room.jpg` -> https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=6
- `onsen-etiquette-washing.jpg` -> https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=7
- `onsen-local-visitors.jpg` -> https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=8
- `onsen-relaxation-area.jpg` -> https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=9

## Time Synchronization Test:
- Step 1 (45 seconds): 3 images changing every 15 seconds
- Step 2 (60 seconds): 3 images changing every 20 seconds  
- Step 3 (75 seconds): 3 images changing every 25 seconds

This demonstrates the time-synchronized image functionality where images automatically change based on the current audio playback time.
