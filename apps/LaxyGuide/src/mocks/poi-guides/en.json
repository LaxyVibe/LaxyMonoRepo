                "highlight": "The Beppu Hells Tour is one of Beppu's most iconic sightseeing routes, combining hot spring viewing with cultural themes to create a unique visual and sensory experience. Unlike typical hot springs focused on bathing, the Hells Tour is centered on observing the spectacular wonders of hot springs, featuring multiple distinct hells that allow visitors to fully appreciate the mystery and grandeur of geothermal activity.\n\nThe Hells Tour encompasses eight main hot spring attractions: Umi Jigoku (Sea Hell), Chinoike Jigoku (Blood Pond Hell), Oniyama Jigoku (Demon Mountain Hell), Shiraike Jigoku (White Pond Hell), Tatsumaki Jigoku (Spout Hell), Yama Jigoku (Mountain Hell), Onishi Bouzu Jigoku (Demon Stone Monk Hell), and Kamado Jigoku (Cooking Pot Hell). Each location offers different geothermal phenomena and exhibits; some are vivid red like blood, others are deep blue like the sea. There are even crocodile breeding areas and geothermal steaming food experiences, making it a diverse sightseeing route that blends nature with culture.\n\nSome hells are a bit far apart, so it's recommended to use city buses or drive. You can also purchase a Hells Tour pass to visit all eight at a discounted price. It's suitable for a half-day to full-day in-depth tour.",

In recent years, the shrine has become a popular \"pilgrimage site\" for fans of the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba anime, due to the shared \"Kamado\" name with the protagonist Tanjiro, the shrine's demon-slaying legends, the \"Kamado Kagura\" dance, and symbolic dragon imagery, creating a unique blend of ancient tradition and modern pop culture.",
