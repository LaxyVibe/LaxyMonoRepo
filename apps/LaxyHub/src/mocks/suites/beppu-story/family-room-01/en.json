The festivities include parades, traditional performances, and the unique \"\"Yu-Kake Matsuri\"\" (Hot Water Splashing Festival), where participants splash hot spring water onto the crowd, creating an incredibly lively scene.\n\nAnother unique event is the Ogiyama Fire Festival, a ceremony where fires are set on Mount Ogiyama to pray for health, longevity, and prosperity throughout the year. However, please note that this fire festival usually takes place in early February, on a different date from the Onsen Festival, and is a spectacular sight unique to Beppu's winter.",

This cooking method has been passed down since the Edo period, involving placing vegetables, seafood, meats, and other ingredients into a steamer basket and cooking them directly with high-temperature steam erupting from underground, without adding a single drop of oil or water, preserving the ingredients' original flavor and nutrients.\n\nThe Kobo offers two ways to experience it: you can choose from the set menus provided on-site, or you can bring your own ingredients for DIY steaming (a facility usage fee applies). The hands-on experience is both fun and memorable, making it a popular unique Beppu activity for families, friends, and couples.\n\nThe restaurant has a spacious dining area, but it does not offer takeout or delivery services. Located in the heart of the Kannawa Onsen area, it's easily accessible and a must-try local dining experience when visiting Beppu.",

Shaped like a giant Tengu mask (a mythical guardian of mountains and forests in Japanese folklore), it symbolizes warding off evil and protection. This statue is not only a symbol of local belief but also a popular photo spot for visitors to Beppu.\n\nThe Tengu's prominent nose and stern expression are said to represent masculine power and blessings. Many tourists pose in front of or beside it, and it takes on a more mysterious aura when illuminated at night. It's rumored that some hidden Easter eggs can be found by observing the statue from behind, adding an element of playful discovery for visitors.\n\nConveniently located near Beppu Station, it also connects to Yayoi Shopping Street, once a bustling shopping area for locals. Although it no longer draws the crowds it once did, this Tengu statue quietly guards Beppu's street corners and memories, making it a cultural landmark not to be missed during a stroll.",

Unlike typical hot springs focused on bathing, the Hells Tour is centered on observing the spectacular wonders of hot springs, featuring multiple distinct hells that allow visitors to fully appreciate the mystery and grandeur of geothermal activity.\n\nThe Hells Tour encompasses eight main hot spring attractions: Umi Jigoku (Sea Hell), Chinoike Jigoku (Blood Pond Hell), Oniyama Jigoku (Demon Mountain Hell), Shiraike Jigoku (White Pond Hell), Tatsumaki Jigoku (Spout Hell), Yama Jigoku (Mountain Hell), Onishi Bouzu Jigoku (Demon Stone Monk Hell), and Kamado Jigoku (Cooking Pot Hell). Each location offers different geothermal phenomena and exhibits; some are vivid red like blood, others are deep blue like the sea. There are even crocodile breeding areas and geothermal steaming food experiences, making it a diverse sightseeing route that blends nature with culture.\n\nSome hells are a bit far apart, so it's recommended to use city buses or drive. You can also purchase a Hells Tour pass to visit all eight at a discounted price. It's suitable for a half-day to full-day in-depth tour.",
